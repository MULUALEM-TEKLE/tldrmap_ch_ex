# Progress

**Memory Bank Creation:**

- `productContext.md`: Created and populated with initial information from `manifest.json`.
- `activeContext.md`: Created and populated with the current task and next steps.
- `techContext.md`: Created and populated with initial information about languages, technologies, and libraries.
- `systemPatterns.md`: Created with placeholders for system architecture details. Further investigation is needed.
- `progress.md`: Currently being updated.

**Overall Project Progress:**

- Added a "MODE" button to the `popup.html` file (positioned in the top right corner). Functionality for this button has been implemented in `popup.js` to toggle between light and dark modes. The button text dynamically updates to indicate the next mode. Button styling has been improved for better dark/light mode contrast. The "map" and "save" buttons now have dark outlines in light mode and light outlines in dark mode. The "save" button text remains green in both modes. The downloaded image now uses the correct background and text color based on the current mode, and uses a solid background color instead of a gradient.
