# System Patterns

The overall system architecture is currently unclear. Further investigation is needed to understand the interaction between the frontend (Chrome extension) and any potential backend components. The use of a `docker-compose.yml` file suggests a containerized backend, but the specific technology and architecture need to be determined. The interaction between the content script, background script, and popup UI also needs to be analyzed.
