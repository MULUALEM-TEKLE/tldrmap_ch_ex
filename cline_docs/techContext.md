- Potentially a backend component (indicated by the presence of `docker-compose.yml`). Further investigation is needed to determine the specific technology used.

**Libraries:**

The presence of a `libs/` directory suggests the use of external JavaScript libraries. These will need to be identified by examining the code in the `libs/` directory.

**Development Setup:**

Further information is needed to fully document the development setup.
