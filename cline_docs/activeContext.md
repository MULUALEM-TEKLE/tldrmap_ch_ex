# Active Context: Settings Dialog Implementation

Implemented a settings dialog for API key management. The dialog is opened via a new "Settings" button in the popup. The `popup.js` script now handles the dialog and communication with the background script to update the API key. The next step is to thoroughly test the updated functionality.
