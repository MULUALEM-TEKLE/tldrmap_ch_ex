Refactored `popup.js` and `popup.html` to use toasts instead of a full-screen loading indicator. The loading indicator styles have been removed from `popup.html`, and `popup.js` now uses the existing toast functionality to display messages for mapping progress and errors. The `showLoading()` and `hideLoading()` functions have been replaced with `showMappingToast()`, `showMapGeneratedToast()`, and `showTryAgainToast()`. These functions use a helper function `showCustomToast()` to display toasts with custom background colors. All changes are complete.
