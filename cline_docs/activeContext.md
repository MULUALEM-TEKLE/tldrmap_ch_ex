## Current Task: Improve Error Handling in Background Script

The task was to enhance the error handling in `background.js` to include canceling the loading screen when map generation fails. This involved adding a call to `chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ action: "hideLoadingOverlay" })` within the `catch` block of the `getText` message handler.

The `replace_in_file` tool was successfully used to make this change in `popup.js`. The updated `background.js` file is now correctly handling errors and canceling the loading screen. Testing confirmed that both the toast messages and loading screen cancellation are working correctly.
